# greeter

Personal shell greeter for fish shell. Would probably work with other shells, although applying it would be slightly different. Probably not portable to other unix systems. This implementation is a rewrite of a fishscript version, which took ~350ms. Now it just takes ~40ms, most of which is shelling out to a command to get audio level. Fun little project to learn a bit of rust and make my terminal start faster.
